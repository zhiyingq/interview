HTML DOM (document object model) tree 
## Tags

	<html> element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document
	all other elements must be descendants of this element
<title>: The <title> tag is required in all HTML documents and it defines the title of the document. Inside <head>
<a href=“www.google.com”>Google</a>
<img src=“” alt=“”>

## Block elements & inline elements
 A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can), such as <div></div>
 Block level elements in HTML:
<div>, <p>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <dl>, <pre>, <hr>

An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
Inline elements in HTML:
<span, ><a>, <button>, <input>, <label>, <select>, <textarea>
